    "Given a metabolic network that could be loaded as a cobra model (eq. in sbml format for instance), derive a list of genes that regulates directly the network's metabolic reactions (later, this list is refered as Targets).\n",
    "Then, this list is used to find the Drugs having a direct impact on the metabolism (from the KeggDrugs repository).\n",
    "pyBravo is then used to reconstruct the upstream gene regulatory network of the Targets genes. This provides to a bigger list of direct and undirect regulators (this list is refered as CompleteTargets) which allows to find the Drugs having a non direct impact on the metabolism.\n",

    "Notice that when the metabolic network is provided with a functioning objective function, a single reaction deletion analysis is first performed to reduce the size Targets gene list and focus on the genes having an effect on the objective value."
